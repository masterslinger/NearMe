            Sprawling and residential, Porur is known for the expansive lake of the same name and the small, waterside Porur Lake 
            Shiva Temple. Nearby, the centuries-old Sri Ramanaadheswarar Temple has an ornately carved gopura gateway tower. Clothing 
            and appliances stores, Indian restaurants, and the N.S.N. produce and fish markets cluster at the busy junction of 
            Kundrathur Main Road and Mount Poonamalle High Road.
